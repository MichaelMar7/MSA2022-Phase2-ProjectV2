# MSA2022-Phase2-ProjectV2

This is my project for MSA 2022 Phase 2. I will be doing the Front-End Module and Data Science Module.

## Front-End Module

my assignment for the Front-End Module is in the ```Front-End``` Folder. There are two parts of the Front-End Module, the first is the ```Pokedex-Test-Project``` where it's my Pokemon search API. Not my main Front-End project. Main project is in the ```Main-Project```. which uses the free third party RESTFUL API **AnimeChan** created by *rocktimsaikia*, which either generates a random quote from an anime or generates a quote from either an anime show or from an anime character.

## Data Science Module
