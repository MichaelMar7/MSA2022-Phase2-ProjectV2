# MSA2022-Phase2-ProjectV2

This is my project for MSA 2022 Phase 2. I will be doing the Front-End Module and Data Science Module.

## Front-End Module

My assignment for the Front-End Module is in the ```Front-End``` Folder. There are two parts of the Front-End Module, the first is the ```Pokedex-Test-Project``` where it's my Pokemon search API. Not my main Front-End project. Main project is in the ```Main-Project```. which uses the free third party RESTFUL API **AnimeChan** created by *rocktimsaikia*, which either generates a random quote from an anime or generates a quote from either an anime show or from an anime character.

Read the ```README.md``` file within the folder to open the API.

## Data Science Module

My assignment for the Data-Science Module is in the ```Data-Science``` Folder. The assignment is to use data from a file ```weather-data.csv``` to perform EDA on the data and then model the data to predict the data a month after the data's latest date. My note, code and obervations are in the ```Data-Science-Project.ipynb``` file.
